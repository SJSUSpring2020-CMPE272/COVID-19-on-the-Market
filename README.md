## Project Idea 1 Abstract

1. Heart Disease Detection

2. About 600,000 Americans die from heart disease each year, which accounts for 
1/4 deaths. Doctors try to diagnose these problems as soon as possible to give proper care to 
patients. Looking at results of blood tests and other related tests can prolong the time it takes for
A patient to receive treatment.

3. This is for doctors who are usually busy attending to other patients that time for diagnosis becomes
Rather lengthy to perform. Our hope is that an application to  speed up the diagnosis processes will allow
For doctors to speed up the time it takes to finalize results so that it would increase the efficiency
Of getting patients treated. Also, a patient can also use this application if they have the results themselves

## Project Idea 2 
1. Prediction of Wild Fire causes

2. Depending on the characteristic of a wildfire, determine what was the cause given a set of data.

3. This is allow government entities from preventing similar wild fires from happening again, or to help law enforcement determine the culprit.

4. Machine Learning / Deep Neural Networks, SQL database
