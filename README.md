## Project Idea 2 
1. Prediction of Wild Fire causes

2. Depending on the characteristic of a wildfire, determine what was the cause given a set of data.

3. This is allow government entities from preventing similar wild fires from happening again, or to help law enforcement determine the culprit.

4. Machine Learning / Deep Neural Networks, SQL database
