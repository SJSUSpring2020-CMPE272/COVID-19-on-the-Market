## Project Idea 1

1. Heart Disease Detection

2. About 600,000 Americans die from heart disease each year, which accounts for 
1/4 deaths. Doctors try to diagnose these problems as soon as possible to give proper care to 
patients. Looking at results of blood and other related tests can prolong the time it takes for
A patient to receive treatment. This project should allow for the input of various test data, and determine whether the
person associated with the test has a heart disease or not. Machine learning can be used to create a model based on the given data set. We can also deploy it on the cloud and create a good UI using frontend/backend technologies. 

3. This is for doctors who are usually busy attending to other patients that time for diagnosis becomes
Rather lengthy to perform. Our hope is that an application to speed up the diagnosis processes will allow
For doctors to speed up the time it takes to finalize results so that it would increase the efficiency
Of getting patients treated. Also, a patient can also use this application if they have the results themselves.

## Project Idea 2 
1. Prediction of Wild Fire causes

2. 4/5 wild fires are caused by humans. (https://nhmu.utah.edu/sites/default/files/attachments/Wildfire%20FAQs.pdf) Wild fires are devasting to the environment, as many animals and houses are lost. Prevention of the causes of these 
widespread fires are of the upmost priority in preserved wildlife and protecting towns. If investigators could predict what 
was the causes of these fires, it could assist in leading them to the culprit responsible. Using Machine Learning on an existing dataset, we can use Tensorflow/Keras to create a model for predicting root causes of wild fires. MySQL databases can store this data , and receive more when fires occur. We can also have a user interface, as well as deployment on a cloud. 

3. The goal of this project is to ultimately prevent these fires from happening in the first place. Given fires occuring in California, Australia, and in the Amazon, the damages are immeasurable. We hope that past data on fires would provide an insight on who is ultimately responsible.

## Project Idea 3

1. Recipe Suggester

2. Many people have a lot of food just in their pantries or refridgerators and do not know what to do with all the food that they have stored away. People will be able to add the ingredients that they own and will be shown suggested recipes based on those ingredients. Users can also refine the results by adding additional constraints such as recipe ratings, time, cost, nutrition, and dietary restrictions.

3. This is to help people figure out what to cook, based on what ingredients they already have. This project can help them empty out their pantries or refridgerators by suggesting recipes that use ingredients that they have, and will also help people become more environmentally friendly by reducing food waste.
